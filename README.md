## Projects 
### Analytical Approach for DFS
 
Developed an advanced analytics system to optimize NBA fantasy lineups, enhancing strategic decision-making in daily fantasy sports.
Utilized machine learning algorithms to project NBA player performance based on historical data, incorporating variables such as player conditions, past scores, and opponent strength.
Implemented an integer programming model using Python's PuLP package to construct 100 unique fantasy lineups while adhering to standard fantasy sports constraints, including budget limits and position requirements.
Introduced an innovative overlap constraint in the lineup construction model to ensure minimal similarity between lineups, promoting diversity in player selection.
Employed dynamic programming techniques to refine lineup selection, optimizing the choice of lineups from the generated pool to ensure minimal overlap and maximize potential scoring.
Created and analyzed a network graph to uncover deeper strategic insights and enhance the predictive aspects of lineup construction, aiming to apply these strategies in real-world fantasy sports scenarios.
Achieved practical relevance and theoretical excellence, aligning the project with academic constructs and methodologies while addressing real-world applications in daily fantasy sports.
